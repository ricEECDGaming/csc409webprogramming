                    <p class="topic1MainText">A fan-favorite feature of the critically acclaimed indie platform fighting game Rivals of Aether is the integration of the Steam Workshop, allowing for community members to create their own custom characters, stages, character skins and buddies for anyone to use! Announced a few years after the game's launch, this side addition has proven to be one of the most well-known and discussed parts of the original Rivals of Aether and has garnered a very active following and dedicated community.</p>

                    <p class="topic2MainText">Compared to other games which have similar custom content related things, the barrier to entry is very low and easily accessible with various pixel art tools and a relatively simple-to-understand programming language, allowing for anyone of almost any skill level to be able to create and share something. Over 4000 characters (at the time of writing this) have been made available as addons, in addition to a ton of other custom stages and game modes entirely!</p>
